# just-me
Hi! I’m Ari from Purbalingga, studying Land Resource Planning at Jenderal Soedirman University. As an ISFP, I enjoy quiet moments, warm conversations, and genuine connections. I love K-dramas, and spending time with my cat, Kuro. One of my simple joys is original chicken noodles (mie ayam) without vegetables incredibly delicious.
